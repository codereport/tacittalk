**About the Guests**

[Aaron Hsu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arcfide/) is the implementor of [Co-dfns](https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns) and an advocate for a terse and minimal array programming style. Hsu has a background in academic functional programming, and was primarily a Scheme programmer for ten years before learning APL. He was introduced to APL by Morten Kromberg while working on a GPU-hosted compiler, and switched to Dyalog APL for the project, which is now Co-dfns.
